Installation Instructions: Website Portfolio deployed by Netlify.

Technologies used: 
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap/Flexbox, JavaScript, jQuery

Approach taken: 
Began with building wireframes and setting deadlines for myself. 

Layout: Less is more. Wanted to include the most important information but not overload the user especially for the home page. 

Decided to build a top nav bar because it was easier to make responsive ex. Smaller screens will have a hamburger menu. 

After my layout was decided I began building my nav bar first, transferring that to every page then went back and built the rest of the pages one by one while focusing on different languages. I created the HTML for each page, then went back and did the CSS, and finally used JavaScript to complete my interactive objects. Bootstrap was used for positioning.

Interaction Point 1 (Home Page): on the home page user can hover over the images and an overlay with text will appear. Hovering out wit=ll remove any text over the images on that page. 

Interaction Point 2 (Navigation): Hamburger menu used HTML for elements, CSS for styling and hover effects, JavaScript will show/hide elements. 

Interaction Point 3: (Projects Page): Projects page showcases 4 projects at a time, with my most current work being the largest image. There will be no text for each image until the user clicks the image for more information, text will appear at the bottom. 

Main Challenges: Making everything mobile-friendly. Adjusting the heights for the different mobile sizes was challenging as some pages needed 100% heights while others did not need a set height for the background images to cover.
